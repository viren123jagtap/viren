V and V Model:

1. In the prototype model we have two different disadvantages, No parallel delivarables and No requirement review process. 
2. To avoid this Disadvantages we aprroach v and v model, in which verification and validation this two phases are referred by v model.
3. In one phase we do verification and another phase we do validaion, that the reason we called v and v model.
4. when ever we have complex requirement then we go with V and V Model.
5. In this model once Bussiness Analyst collects all the requirement then it is handover to the development team as well as testing team.
6. Development team will start convert all CRS into SRS and testing team review CRS they check any missing and wrong requirment and write acceptance test document.
7. Once the SRS is prepared devlopment team start HLD desining and again testing team review HLD and write the system test document, after completing HLD 
   devlopment team is go with LLD and tetsing team review Integration test document.
8. once LLD submit and review by developer coding part is started and after  that tetsing team review unit test document. 
9. this process continue still the application is bug free.
